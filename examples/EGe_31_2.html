<body><div><span>Sport is very popular nowadays. People not only like to do it, but to watch sports. I think that most </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">of the </del><span>people ha</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s his</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ve a</ins><span> favourite sports team or sportsman, whom you like to cheer </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">up</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">on</ins><span> and to whom you wish more wins. But there are some people who think that watching sports is not an important activity </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">for</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">in</ins><span> our lives. I disagree with them and th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">at</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">is</ins><span> is why. <br>First of all, when people attend some sports events or just get together and watch championships online, they feel like they belong to something global. They feel </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a </ins><span>connection </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">between</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">with</ins><span> each other and it seems like they are one big family. They really are. Remember when in Ancient Greece </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">the </ins><span>Olympic games </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">were </del><span>started, wars were paused? Do you understand the great importance of it? Sports events connect people and create peace in the world. <br>Secondly, watching sports inspire</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span> us to create wonderful things. I mean that when you watch how sportsmen </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">are </del><span>play</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ing</del><span> and then win</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ning</del><span> the prize, you understand how really hard they worked for it, so it makes you get out of bed and you start doing sports, or you start trying to study more, or make your career grow. Sport is like art - when you watch it, you feel inspired and refreshed. <br>Finally, you </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">even ca</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">can eve</ins><span>n make a career while watching sports! For example, you can become a sports events commentator, or a sports journalist. There are a lot of ways to find a job in </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">the </ins><span>sports sphere. If you are really interested in sport and you understand what it is made of, then you should not blow your chance to get in the sports industry! <br>In conclusion I would like to say that you are not wasting your time while watching sports. How </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">can </ins><span>something </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">can </del><span>be a waste of time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> if it makes you happy and inspired?</span></div></body></html>
